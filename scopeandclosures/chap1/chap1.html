/* Understanding javascript

1. Engine responsible for start-to-finish compliation and excution of our javascript program

2. Compiler works with Engine; Handles all the dirty work of parsing and code-generation

3. Scope works with Engine; Collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables) and
   enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.

Consider the following code:
*/

function foo(a) { //Here the value 2 is assigned implicitly this a LHS reference
	console.log( a ); // 2. This is a RHS look-up for the console object
}

foo( 2 ); // This is a RHS reference to foo meaning go and look up the value of foo, and give it to me

/*

Engine: Hey Scope, I have RHS reference for foo?ify all the LHS look-ups (there are
Scope: Yes I have. Compiler declared it as a formal parameter to foo just secs ago.
Engine: Thanks. Now, time to assign 2 to a
Engine: Hey Scope I need a RHS look up for console?
Scope: Yes I've got console he's built-in
Engine: looking up log() great its a function.
Engine: Scope got a RHS reference to a?
Scope: Same guy as I gave you before still 2
Engine: passing the value of a, which is 2, into log(..)
*/

function boo(f) { //LHS lookup implicit parameter assignment
	var d = f;      //LHS Lookup for the value of d & RHS lookup for the value of f
	return f + d;  // LHS lookup for the value of d and RHS lookup for the value of f
}

var e = boo( 2 ); // LHS lookup for the value of e & RHS lookup for the function boo(..)

// Had abit of trouble with this.
