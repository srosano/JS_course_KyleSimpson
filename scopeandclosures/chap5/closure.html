/*

CLOSURE IS WHEN A FUNCTION IS ABLE TO REMEBER AND ACCESS ITS LEXICAL SCOPE EVEN WHEN THAT FUNCTION IS EXECUTING
OUTSIDE ITS LEXICAL SCOPE

The function bar() has a lexical scope access to the inner scope of dude().
The function bar, the function itself, and pass it as value. In this case we return the value function object itself
that bar references.

After we execute dude(), we assign the value it returned (our inner bar() function) to a variable called spaz,
and then we actually invoke spaz(), which of course is invoking our inner bar(), just by a different identifier reference.

bar() is executed for sure. But in this case, it is executed outside its declared lexical scope.

After dude() is executed, normally we would expect the entire scope of dude() would go away, because we know that the
Engine employs a garbage collector that comes along and freeds up memory when its no longer in use.
Since it would appear that the contents of dude() are no longer in use, it would seem that it should be considered gone.

But the "magic" of closures does not let this happen. WHY? because the inner scope is in fact still "in use" HOW?
who's using it? The function bar() itself.

bar() has a lexial scope closure over that inner scope of dude(), which keeps that scope alive for bar() to reference
at any later time.

bar() still has a reference to that scope, and that reference is called closure!!

So the variable baz is invoked ( invoking the inner function we initially labeled bar ), it duly has access to author-time
lexical scope, so it can access the variable a just as we expect.

/* We have an inner function named timer and we pass that function
to function named setTimeout(..). But timer has a scope closure
over the scope of wait(..), indeed keeping an using a reference to
the variable message.

A thousand milliseconds after we have executed wait(..) and its inner
scope should otherwise be long gone, that inner function timer still
has closure over that scope.

So eventually the Engine, the built-in utility setTimeout(..) has a
reference to some parameter probably called fv or func etc. Engine then
goes on to invoke that function, which is invoking our inner timer function,
and the lexical scope reference is still intact.

console.log( "Example Four");

for (var i=1 ; i<=6; i++){

}*/

/* This is a for loop that specifies the statements 1, 2 and 3 respectively
We can see the i variabe will be incremented till it's more than or equal to 5.

We would expect that this would print out 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 printed out,
one at a time, one per a second appox.

However this particular code above doesn't perform as the user expects WHY?

Because the terminating condition of the loop is when i is not more than or equal to 5.
The first time that's the case is when i = 6. So the output is reflecting that
value after the loop terminates.

The timeout functions callbacks are all running well after the completion of the loop.
In fact as timers go, even if it were setTimeout(..,0) on each iteraction, all
those functions would run strictly after completion of the loop, and thus print 6 each time.

What is missing from our code to actually have it behave as we have semantically have implied?

We are trying to imply that each iteration of the loop "captures" it's own copy of i, at the
time of the iteration. But the way scope works, all 5 of these functions, though they
are defined separately in loop iteration, though they are defined separately in each loop iteration,
ALL ARE CLOSED OVER THE SAME SHARED GLOBAL SCOPE, which has, in fact, only one i in it.

See below for a solution:

  })();
}
*/
/* Here we are using the IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression.

Does it work? NO

WHY?

Because even though we have more lexical scope. Each timeout function callback is
indeed closing over it's own per-iteration scope created specifically by each IIFE.

It's not enoughtto have a scope close over IF THAT SCOPE IS EMPTY. Look closely, our
IIFE scope is simply an empty do-nothing scope - It needs something track its variable.

  (function(g){
    setTimeout( function clock(){
      console.log( g );
    }, g*1000 );
  })( k );
}*/

/* Since these IIFE are just functions, we can pass the k, and we can call it g if
we prefer, or we can even call it k again.

The use of IIFE inside each iteration has created a new scope for each iteration,
which gave our timeout functions callbacks the opportunity to close over a new scope
for each iteraction, one which had a variable with the right per-iteration value
for us to access.

/*
The Module is just a function, but it has to be invoked for there to be a module instance
created. Without the excution of the outer function, the creation of the inner
scopes and closures would not occur.

The module() function returns an object, denoted by the object-literal syntax
{key : value,} in this case {doSomething : doSomething, doAnother : doAnother}.
This has references to our inner function, but not our inner data variables.
We keep those hidden and private.
This functions essentially like a public API for our module.

This object return value is ultimately assigned to the outer variable foo, and
then we can access those property methods on the API, like foo.doSomething().

The doSomething and doAnother functions have closure over the inner scope of the
module "instance" (arrived at actually invoking module() ). When we transport these
functions outside the lexical scope, by the way of property references on the object
we return, we have now set up a conditionby which closure can be observed and exercised.

There are two requirements for the module pattern to be exercised:

1. There must be an outer enclosing function, and it most be invoked at least once
(each time creates a new module instance).

2. The enclosing functon must return back at least one inner function, so that
this inner function has closure over the private scope, and can access and/or
modify that private state.

An object with a function property on it is not REALLY a module. An object which is
returned from a function invocation which only has data properties on it and no closured
functions is not REALLY a module, in the observable sense.

This example below shows a standalone module which can be invoked any number of times,
each time creating a new module instance. This slight variation */
