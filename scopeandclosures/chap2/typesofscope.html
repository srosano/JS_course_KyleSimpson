/* There are two types of scope Lexical and Dynamic

lexing process examines some string of source code characters and assigns semantic
meaning to the tokens as a result of some stateful parsing.


This is based on where variables and blocks of scope are authored, by you, at write time,
and thus (mostly) set in stone by the time the lexer processes your code.

function foo(a){ // bubble 1
  var b = a * 2;  // bubble 2
  function bar(c){ // bubble 3
    console.log(a, b, c);
  }

  bar(b * 3 );
}

foo( 2 );

/*
Bubble 1 encompasses the global scope, and has just one identifer in it: foo

bubble 2 encompasses the scope of foo, which includes three identifers: a, b, bar

Bubble 3 encompasses the scope of bar, and includes just one identifer: c

Lexical scope is only defined where the function was declared

Now how to "cheat" Lexical scope:
*/
console.log("cheating lexical scope using eval():");

function boo(str, a){
  eval ( str ); // Cheating
  console.log( a, b);
}

var b = 2;

boo("var b = 3;", 1 ); // 1 3 instead of 1 2

/*
The string "var b = 3;" is treated at the point of the eval(..) call, as code was
there all along. Because the code happens to declare a new variable b, it modifies
the existing lexical scope of boo(..)

You can see that the b variable is actually declared inside within boo(..) that
shadows the b variable that was declared in the outer (global) scope.

However using "use strict" will generate a reference error instead.

Now showing an example of cheating lexical scope using 'with'
*/
console.log("cheating lexical scope using the with():");
var obj = {a:2,b:2,c:3};

//more "tedious" to repeat "obj"
obj.a = 2;
obj.b = 3;
obj.c = 4;

//easier short-hand
with(obj){
  a = 3;
  b = 4;
  c = 5;
}

function moo(obj){ // takes an object reference as an argument, and calls with (obj) on the reference
  with (obj){
    a = 2;         //normal lexical reference to variable a
  }
}

var o1 = {a:3};
var o2 = {b:3};

moo( o1 );
console.log( o1.a );  // 2

moo( o2 );
console.log( o2.a );  //undefined
console.log( a );     // 2 -- leaked global

/*
Two objects are created o1 and o2.

One has an a property and the other does not.

When we pass in the o1, the a = 2 assignment finds the property o1.a and assigns it
the value 2.

However when we pass in the o2, since it does not have 'a' property, no such property is
created, and o2, remains undefined.

global variable a was created by the a = 2 assignment. How can this be?
The with statement takes an object, one that has zero or more properties, and
treats that object as if it is wholly seperate lexical scope, and thus the objects
properties are treated as lexically defined identifers in that "scope".

N: Even though a with block treats an object like a lexical scope, a normal var declaration
inside that with blockwill not be scoped to that with block, but instead to the containing function scope.

Neither the "scope" of o2, nor the scope of moo(..), nor the global scope even, has 'a' identifer to be
found, so when 'a = 2' is executed, it results in the automatic global being created (since we're in non-strict mode).

Clearly using eval() and with are bad coding practices if used can affect lexical scope and affect performance

Very interesting concepts and really shows us the disadvantages of using the eval() and 'with' statements
Probably one of the most interesting things to know with javascript.
