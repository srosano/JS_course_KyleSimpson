/* Most commonly developers tend to think of "this" as refering to
the function itself.

Also they think that referencing the function as an object (all functions
in js are objects) lets you store state (values in properties) between
function calls.

the code below shows how "this" doesn't let a function get a reference
to itself like we might have assumed. */

/*
foo.count is still 0, even though the four console.log() statements
clearly indicate foo() was called four times. This problem stems from
a too literal interpretation of what "this" (in this.count++) means.

when the code executes foo.count = 0, its adding property count to the
function object foo.  But for the this.count reference inside of the
function, this is not in fact pointing at all to that function object,
and so even though the property names are the same, the root objects
are different, and confusion ensues.

A better way of fixing this is to force "this" to actually point
at the foo function object */

function foo (num) {
  console.log( "foo: " + num);

  // keep track of how many times 'foo is called'
  // Note" 'this' IS actually 'foo' now, based on
  // how 'foo' is called (see below)
  this.count++;

}

foo.count = 0;

var i;

for (i=0; i <10; i++){
  if(i>5) {
    // Using 'call(..)', we ensure the 'this'
    // points at the function object ('foo') itself
    foo.call( foo, i); // call method with an owner object as an argument (parameter)

/* IT'S SCOPE

Next misconceptions is that "this" somehow refers to the functions
scope. Its a two pronged question because there's some truth in it
but it is also a misguided understanding.

"this" does NOT in any way refer to a function's lexical scope. It is
true that internally, scope is a kind of like an object with properties
for each of the available identifiers. But the scope "object" is NOT
accessible to javascript code. It's part of the Engine's implementation
*/

function foo(){
  var a = 2;
  this.bar():
}

function bar(){
  console.log( this.a );
}

foo();

/* This code tries to attempt to refernece the bar() function
via this.bar(). It is certainly an accident that it works, but how?

The most natural way to to have invoked bar() would have been to omit
the leading "this."" and just make a lexical reference to the identifier

However the developer who writes such code is attempting to use this
to create a bridge between the lexical scopes of foo() and bar(), so
that bar() has access to the variable a in the inner scope of foo().
No such bridge is possible. You cannot use a "this" reference to look
something up in lexical scope. It is not possible.

If you feel yourself trying to mix lexical scope look ups with "this",
remind yourself there's no bridge.*/

/*
SO WHAT IS "THIS"?
"this" is not author-time binding but a runtime binding. It is based on
conditions of the functions invocation "this" binding has nothing to do
with where a function is declared, but instead everything to do with the
manner in which the function is called.

When a function is invoked, an activation record, otherwise known as execution
context, is created. This records contains information about where the function
was called from (the call-stack), how the function was invoked, what parameters
were passed, etc. One of the properties of this record is the "this" reference
which will be used for the duration of that function's execution.
