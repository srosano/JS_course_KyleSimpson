/* "this" is a binding made for each function invocation, based entirely on its
call-site (how the function is called) */

/*
To understand "this", we have to understand deeply how the call-site: the location
in code where a function is called (not where it's declared). We must inspect the
call-site to answer the question: what's this "this" a reference to?

Finding the call-site is generally "go locate where a function is called from",
but this is not always easy, as certain coding can obscure the the true call-site.

Notice the way the foo() is declared and then later added as a reference property
onto "obj". Regardless of whether foo() is initally declared on obj, or is added
as a reference later (as the code shows), in neither care is the function really
"owned" or "contained" by the obj object.

However, the call-site uses the obj context to reference the function, so you could
say that obj "owns" or "contains" the function reference at the time the function is
called.

Whatever you choose to call this pattern, at that point that foo() is called,
it's preceded by an object reference to "obj". When  there is a context for a function
reference, the implicit binding rule says that it's that object which should be
used for the function's call's "this" binding.

Because the "obj" is the "this" for the foo() call, this.a is the same as obj.a

/* EXPLICIT BINDING */
/*
With implicit binding we had to mutate the object in question  to include a reference
on itself to the function, and use this property function reference to indirectly
(implicitly) bind "this" to the object.

What if you want to force a function call to use a particular object for the "this"
binding, without putting a property function reference on the object?

"All" functions in the language have some utilities available to them (via their [[Prototype]] )
which can be useful for this task. specifically functions have call(..) and apply(..) methods.
Javascript host enviroments sometimes provide functions which are special enough that they do
not have such functionality. But those are few. The vast majority of functions provided, and
certainly all functions you will create, do have access to call(..) and apply(..)

How do these utilities work? They both take, as their first parameter, an object to use for the
"this", and then invoke the function with that "this" specified. Since you are directly stating
what you want the "this" to be, we call it explicit binding.
*/

function foo()  {

}

var obj ={
  a: 2,
};

/* Invoking foo with the explicit binding by foo.call(..) allows us to force its "this"
to be "obj"

If you pass a simple primitive value (of type string, boolean or number) as the "this"
binding, the primitive value is wrapped in its object-form (new String(..), new Boolean(..) or new Number(..) ).
This is often referred to as boxing.

Unfortuately, explicit binding alone still doesn't offer any solution to the issue mentioned previously,
of a function "losing" it's intended "this" binding, or just having it paved over it by a framework.

Hard Binding

// so that it cannot be overwritten

/*
Let's examine how this works:
We create a function bar() which, internally, manually calls, foo.call(obj)
thereby forcibly invoking foo with obj binding for "this". No matter how
you later invoke the function bar, it will always manually invoke foo with
obj. Thus binding is both explicit and strong, so we call it hard binding.

We can wrap a function with a hard binding which creates a pass-thru of any
arguments passed and any return value received:
*/

function foo(something) {
  console.log( this.a, something );
  return this.a + something;

var obj = {

}

var obj = {
  a:2
}

var bar = bind( foo, obj );

var b = bar ( 3 );  // 2 3
console.log( b );  // 5

/*

function foo(something){
  console.log( this.a, something );
  return this.a + something;
}

var obj = {
  a:2
};

var bar = foo.bing( obj );

var b = bar ( 3 );  // 2 3
console.log( b )    // 5
/*

bind(..) returns a new function that is hard-coded to call the original function
with the "this" context set as you specifed.

Note: As of ES6, the hard-bound function produced by bind(..) has a .name
propert that derives from the original target function. For example:
bar = foo.bind(..) should have a bar.name value of "bound foo", which is the
function call name that should show up in a stack trace.

/* "new" Binding  */

/*
The fourth and final rule "this" binding requires us to re-think a very common
misconception about functions and objects in Javascript.

"constructors" are special methods attached to classes, when the class is
instanitated with a "new" operator, the constructor of that class is called.

Looks like this: */

something = new myClass(..);

/* Javascript has a new operator, and the code pattern to use it looks basically
identical to what we see in those class-oriented languages; most developers
assume that Javascript's mechcanism is doing something similar. However, there
really no connection to class-oriented functionality implied be "new" usage in JS.

Let's re-define what a "constructor" in JS is. Constructors are JUST FUNCTIONS
that happen to be called with the new operator in front of them. They are regular
functions that are, in essence, hijackde by the used of "new" in their invocation.

For example, the Number(..) function acting as a constructor:
"When a Number is called as part of a new expression it is a constructor: it
initialises the newly created object."

So, pretty much any old function, including the built-in object functions like
Number(..) can be called with "new" in front of it, and that makes the function
call a 'constructor call'. This is an important but subtle distinction: there's
really no such thing as "constructor functions", but rather construction calls
of functions.

When a function is invoked with "new" in front of it, otherwise known as a
constructor call, the following things are done automatically:

1. a brand new object is created(aka, constructed) out of thin air
2. the newly constructed object is [[Prototype]]-linked
3. the newly constructed object is set as the "this" binding for that function call
4. unless the function returns its own alternate OBJECT, the "new"-invoked function
call will automatically return the newly constructed object

Here is an example:
*/

function foo(a) {
  this.a = a;
}

var bar = new foo( 2 );
console.log( bar.a ); //2
/*
By calling foo(..) with "new" in front of it, we've constructed a new object and
set that new object as the "this" for the call of foo(..). SO "NEW" IS THE FINAL
WAY THAT A FUNCTION CALL'S "THIS" CAN BE BOUND. We'll call this new binding.

So all you need to do is find the call-site and inspect it to see which rule applies.
What id the call-site has multiple eligible rules? There must be an order of
precedence to these rules, and so we will demonstrate what order to apply the rules.

Which has precedence? implicit or explicit binding? Let's test it:
*/
function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var obj1 = {
  a:2,
  foo:foo
};

var obj2 = {
  a:3,
  foo:foo
};


obj1.foo()  // 2
obj2.foo()  // 3

obj1.foo.call()   // 3
obj2.foo.call()   // 2
/*

So, explicit binding takes precedence over implicit binding, which means you should
ask first if explicit binding applies before checking for implicit binding.

Let's find out where new binding fits in the precedence:
*/

function foo(something) {
  this.a = something;
}

var obj1 = {
  foo:foo
};

var obj2 = {};

obj1.foo( 2 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2

obj1.foo.call( obj2, 3 );
console.log( obj2.a );    // 3

var bar = new obj1.foo( 4 );
console.log( obj1.a );
console.log( bar.a );

/*
new binding is more precedent than implicit binding.

But do you think new binding is more or less precedent than explicit binding?

NOTE: "new" and "call"/"apply" cannot be used together, so new foo.call(obj1)
is not allowed, to test new binging directly against explicit binding. But we
can still use hard binding to test the precedence of the two rules.

By that reasoning, it would seem obvious to assume that hard binding (which is
a form of explicit binding) is more precedent than new binding, and thus cannot
be overridden with "new"
*/

function foo(something) {
  this.a = something;
}

var obj1 = {};

var bar = foo.bind( obj1 );
bar( 2 );
console.log( obj1.a );    // 2

var baz = new bar( 3 );
console.log( obj1.a );    // 2
console.log( baz.a );     // 3
/*
Whoa bar is hard-bound against obj1, but new bar(3) did NOT change obj1.a to be 3
as we would have expected. Instead, the hard bound (to obj1) call to bar(..) is
able to be overidden with new. Since new was applied, we got the newly created
object back, which we named baz, and we see in fact that baz.a has the value 3.

Here is a "fake" bind helper:
*/

function bind(fn, obj) {
  return function() {
    fn.apply( obj, arguments );
  };
}

/*
But the built-in Function.prototype.bind(..) as of ES5 is more sophisticated,
quite a bit so in fact. Here is the (slightly reformatted) polyfill provided by
the MDN page for bind(..)
*/
if(!Function.prototype.bind) {
  Function.prototype.bind = function (oThis) {
    if (typeof this !== "function") {
      //closest thing possible to the ECMAScript 5
      // internal IsCallable function
      throw new TypeError( "Function.prototype.bind - what " +
				"is trying to be bound is not callable"
			);
    }

    var aArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 ),
    fToBind = this,
    fNOP = function(){},
    fBound = function(){
      return fToBind.apply(
	(
        	this instanceof fNOP &&
        	oThis ? this : oThis
      	),
					aArgs.concat( Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments ) )
				);
			}
		;

		fNOP.prototype = this.prototype;
		fBound.prototype = new fNOP();

		return fBound;
	};
}
/*
The bind(..) polyfill shown above differs from the built-in bind(..) in ES5 with
respect to hard-bound functions that will be used with new. Because the polyfill
cannot create a functiin without a .prototype as the built-in utility does,
there's some nuanced indirection to approximate the same behaviour. Tread carefully
if you plan to use new with a hard-bound function and you rely on this polyfill.

The part that is allowing new overriding is:

this instanceof fNOP &&
oThis ? this : oThis

// ... and:

fNOP.prototype = this.prototype;
fBound.prototype = new fNOP();

We won't actually dive into too much. Bit essentially the utility determines
whether or not the hard-bound function has been called with new (resulting in a
newly constructed object being its this), and if so, it uses that newly created
this rather than the previously specified hard binding for this.

Why is new being able to override hard binding useful?

The primary reason for this behavour is to create a function (that can be used with
new for constructing objects) that essentially ignores the this hard binding but
which presets some or all of the function's arguments. One of the capabilities of
bind(..) is that any arguments passed after the first this binding argument are
defaulted as standard arguments to the underlying function (technically called
"partial application", which is a subset of "currying").

For example:

----DONT UNDERSTAND THIS DOUBLE CHECK THE CODE:----
*/

function foo(p1,p2) {
  this.val = p1 + p2;
}

// using 'null' here because we don't care about
// the 'this' hard-binding in this scenario, and
// it will be overidden by the 'new' call anyway!

var bar = foo.bind( null, "p1" );

var baz = new bar( "p2" );

baz.val; // p1p2

/*

DETERMINING THIS

Summarising the rules for determining this from a function call's call-site,
in their order of precedence. Ask these questions in order,
and stop when the first rule applies.

1. Is the function called with <code>new</code> (<em>new binding</em>)? If so, "this" is the newly constructed object

<code>var bar = new foo();</code>

2. Is the function called with call or apply (<em>explicit binding</em>), even hidden inside a bind hard binding?
If so, <code>this</code> is the explicitly specified object.

<code>var bar = foo.call( obj2 )

3. Is the function called with a context (<em>implicit binding</em>), otherwise known as owning or containing object? If
so <code>this</code> is that context object

<code>var bar = obj1.foo()</code>

4. Otherwise with the <code>this</code> (<em>default binding</em>). If in <em>strict mode</em>, pick <code>undefined</code>,
otherwise pick the <code>global</code> object.

<code>var bar = foo()</code>

That's it. That's all it takes to understand the rules <code>this</code> binding for normal function calls. Well...ALMOST!!

<h1>Binding Exceptions</h1>

There are some exceptions to the "rules"

The <code>this</code>-binding behavour can in some scenarios be surprising, when you intended a different binding but you
end up with binding behavour from the default binding rule (see previous).

<h2>Ignored <code>this</code></h2>
If you pass <code>null<code> or <code>undefined<code> as a <code>this<code> binding parameter to call, apply, or binds, those
values are effectively ignored, instead the default binding rule applies to the innvocation.

function foo(){
    console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo.call( null );   //2

Why would you intentionally pass something like <code>null</code> for <code>this</code> binding?
It is quite common to use apply(..) for spreading out arrays of values as parameters to a function call. Similarly, <code>bind(..)</code>
can curry parameters(pre-set values), which can be very helpful.

function foo(a,b) {
    console.log("a:" + a + b + ", b:" + b );

}

//spreading out an array as parameters
foo.apply( null, [2,3] );   //a:2  b:3

//currying with 'bind(..)'
var bar = foo.bind( null, 2 );
bar( 3 );   // a:2, b:3

Note: We don't cover it here, ES6 has the <code>...</code> spread operator, which will syntactically "spread out" an array
as paramters without needing <code>apply(..)</code> such as <code>foo( ...[1,2] ), which equates to <code>foo( 1,2 )</code>.
-- syntactically avoiding <code>this</code> binding if it's unnessary. Unfortuately, there is no ES6 syntactic substitute for currying,
so <code>this</code> parameter of the <code>bind(..)</code> call still needs attention.

However there is still a slight hidden "danger" in always using <code>null</code> when you dont care about <code>this</code> binding.
If you ever use the that against a function call (for instance, a thrid-party library function that you don't control), and that function
does make <code>this</code>, the default binding rule means it might inadvertently reference (or worse, mutate!) the <code>global</code>
object (<code>window</code> in the browser).

Obviously, such a pitfall can lead to a variety of very differcult to dianose/track-down bugs.

<h3>safer <code>this</code></h3>

Perhaps a somewhat "safer" practice is to pass a specically set up object for <code>this</code> which is guaranteed not to be an object that
can create problematic side effects in your program. To fix this we can create a "DMZ" (De-Militarized Zone) object - nothing more than a completely
empty, non-delegated object.

If we alwauys pass a DMZ object for ignored <code>this</code> we don't think we need to care about, we're are sure any hidden/unexpected
usage of <code>this</code> will be restricted to the empty object, which insulates our program's <code>global</code> object from side-effects.

Since this object is empty, I personally like the variable name <code>ø</code> (the lowercase mathmatically symbol for the empty set).

Whatever you call it, the easiest way to set it up as TOTALLY EMPTY is <code>Object.create(null)</code> this is simlar to <code>{ }</code>, but
without the delegation to <code>Object.prototype</code>, so it's "more empty" than just <code>{ }</code>

function foo(a,b) {
    console.log( "a:" + a + ", b:" + b );
}

//Our DMZ empty object
var ø = Object.create( null );

//spreading out array as paramters
foo.apply( ø, [2,3] ); // a:2, b:3

//currying with 'bind(..)'
var bar = foo.bind( ø, 2 );
bar( 3 );  // a:2, b:3

Not only functionally "safer", there's a sort of stylistic benefit to ø, in that it semantically conveys "I want the <code>this</code> to be
empty" a little more clearly than a <code>null</code> might.

<h3>Indirection</h3>

Another thing to be aware of is that you can  (intentionally or not!) create "indirect references" to functions, and in those cases,
when that function reference is invoked, the default binding rule also applies.

One of the most common ways that indirect reference can occur is from an assignement:

function foo() {
    console.log( this.a );

}

var a = 2;
var o = { a: 3, foo : foo };
var p = { a:4 };

o.foo();                      // 3
(p.foo = o.foo)();            // 2

The result value of the assignment expression <code>p.foo = o.foo</code> is a reference to just the underlying function object. As such,
the effective call-site is just foo(), not p.foo() or o.foo() as you might expect. Per the rules above, the default binding rule applies.

Reminder: regardless of how you get the function invocation using the default binding rule, the <code>strict mode</code> status of the
contents of the invoked function making the <code>this</code> reference - not a function call-site - determines the default binding value:
either the global object if in non-<code>strict mode</code> or <code>undefined</code> if in <code>strict mode</code>.

<h3>Softening Binding</h3>

We saw earlier that hard binding was one strategy for function call falling back to the default binding rule inadvertently, by forcing it to
be bound to a specific <code>this</code> (unless you use <code>new</code> to override it!). The problem is, hard-binding greatly reduces the
flexibility of a function, preventing manual <code>this</code> override with either the implicit binding or even subsequent explicit binding attempts

It would be nice if there was a way to provide a different default for default binding (not <code>global</code> or <code>undefined</code>), while still
leaving the function able to be manually <code>this</code> bound via implicit binding or explicit binding techniques.

We can create a so-called soft-binding utility which emulates our desired behavour.

if(!Fuction.prototype.softBind) {
    Function.prototype.softBind = function(obj) {
        var fn = this,
            curried = [].slice.call( arguments, 1 ),
            bound = function.bound() {
                return fn.apply(
                (!this ||
                        (typeof window !== "undefined" &&
                                  this === window) ||
                        (typeof global !== "undefined" &&
                                  this === global)
                ) ? obj:this,
                curried.concat.apply( curried, arguments )
              );
          };
          bound.prototype = Object.create( fn.prototype );
          return bound;
  };
}

The softBind(..) utility provided here works simliarly to the built-in ES5 bind(..) utility, except with our soft binding
behavour. It wraps the specified function in a logic that checks the <code>this</code> at call-time and if it's <code>global</code>
or <code>undefined</code>, uses a pre-specified alternate default (<code>obj</code>). Otherwise the <code>this</code> is left untouched.
It also provides optional currying.

Here is the example:

// DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CODE BELOW!!!!!!

function foo() {
  console.log("name: " + this.name);
}

var obj = { name: "obj" },
    obj2 = { name: "obj2" },
    obj3 = { name: "obj3" };

var fooOBJ = foo.softBind( obj );

fooOBJ();  // name: obj

obj2.foo() = foo.softBind(obj);
obj3.foo();  // name: obj2 <--------- LOOK!!

fooOBJ.call( obj3 );   // name: obj3   <--------- LOOK!!

setTimeout( obj2.foo, 10 );  // name: obj   <------ falls back to soft-binding

The soft-bound version of <code>foo()</code> function can be manually <code>this</code>-bound to <code>obj2</code> or <code>obj3</code>
as shown, but it falls back to <code>obj</code> if the default binding would otherwise apply.

<h3>Lexical <code>this<code></h3>

Normal functions abide by the four rules we just covered. But in ES6 introduces a special kind of fuction that does not abide
by those rules an: arrow-function.

Arrow-functions are signified by not the function keywork but by the <code>=></code> "fat arrow" operator. Instead of using the four
standard <code>this</code> rules, arrow-function adopts the <code>this</code> binding from the enclosing (function or global scope).

Here is an example:

function foo() {
    //return an arrow-function
    return(a) => {
        // 'this' here is lexically adopted from 'foo()'
        console.log( this.a );
  };
}

var obj1 = {
      a:2
};

var obj2 = {
      a:3
};

var bar = foo.call( obj1 );
bar.call( obj2 );             //2, not 3!!

The arrow-function created in <code>foo()</code> lexically captures whatever <code>foo()</code>'s <code>this</code> is at
call time. Since <code>foo()</code> was <code>this</code> bound to <code>obj1</code>, <code>bar</code>
(a reference to the returned arrow-function) will also be <code>this</code> bound to <code>obj1</code>. The lexical binding
of an arrow-function cannot be overridden (even with <code>new</code>!)

The most common cause will be the use of call-backs, such as event handlers or timers:

function foo() {
    setTimeout(() => {
        // 'this' here is lexically adopted from 'foo()'
        console.log( this.a );
  },100);
}

var obj = {
    a: 2
};

foo.call( obj );  // 2

While arrow-functions provide an alternative to using bing(..) on a function to ensure its "this", which can seem attactive,
its important to note that they are essentially disabling the traditional "this" mechcanism in favour of more widely-understood
lexical scoping. Pre-ES6, we already have a fairly common pattern for doing so, which is basically almost indistinguishable from
the ES6 arrow-functions:

function foo() {
    var self = this;    //lexical capture of 'this'
    setTimeout( function(){
          console.log( self.a );
  }, 100 );
}

var obj = {
    a:2
};

foo.call( obj );  //2


}

While <code>self = this</code> and arrow-functions both seem like "good" soultions to not wanting to use <code>bind(..)</code>,
they are essentially fleeing from "this" instead of understanding and embracing it.

If you find yourself writing "this"-style code , but most or all of the time, you defeat the "this" mechcanismwith lexical self = this
or arrow-functions "tricks", perhaps you should either:

1. Use lexical scope only and forget the false pretence of "this"-style code

2. Embrace "this"-style code completely, including using bind(..) where necessary, and try to avoid "self = this" and arrow-function
"lexical this" tricks

CONCLUSION

Determine the "this" binding for an execution function requires finding the direct call-site of that function. Once examined, four rules
can be applied to the call-site, in this order of precedence:

1. Called with "new"? Use the newly constructed object
2. Called with call or apply (or bind)? Use the specified object
3. Called with a context object owning the call? Use that context object
4. Default: "undefined" in <code>strict mode</code, global object otherwise

Be careful of accidental/untentional invoking of the default binding rule. In cases where you want to "safely" ignore a "this"
binding, a "DMZ" object like ø = Object.create(null) is a good placeholder value that protects the global object from unintended
side-effects.

Instead of the four binding rules, ES6 arrow-functions use lexical scoping for "this" binding, which means they adopt the
"this" binding (whatever it is) from its enclosing function call. They are essentially a syntactic replacement of <code>self = this</code>
in pre-ES6 coding.
