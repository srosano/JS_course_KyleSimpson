/* The a property doesn't actually exist on the bar object because bar is prototype-linked
   to foo, Javascript automatically falls back to looking for a on the foo  object, where it
   is found.

   A more natural way of applying prototypes is a pattern called "behavour delegation" , where
   you intentially designed your linked objects to be able to delegate from one to the other
   for parts of the needed behavour */
