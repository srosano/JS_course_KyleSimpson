/* The difference here is only whether the conditionals is tested before the first iteration
(while) or after the first iteration (do..while)

During the while loop it will test the condition that the noOfcustomers is more than zero before proceeding with
the contents of that loop

The do while loop the contents of that loop will be run and then while statement will be evaluated after the loop
has completed.

Both these don't work as the noOfcustomers hasn't been set to a number higher than zero and doesn't change */
